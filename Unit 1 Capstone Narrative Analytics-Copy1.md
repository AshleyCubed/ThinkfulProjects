## The main component of this capstone is a research proposal. Using the data set you selected, propose and outline an experiment plan. The plan should consist of three key components:
> - Analysis that highlights your experimental hypothesis.
> - A rollout plan showing how you would implement and rollout the experiment.
> - An evaluation plan showing what constitutes success in this experiment.

### The Data
> The City of Chicago provides a considerable amount of open data for its citizens to explore, which can be found at the Chicago Data Portal (https://data.cityofchicago.org/), which houses thousands of datasets available for viewing, visualizing, and downloading. 

> As a commuter, I've chosen to focus on data for <b>the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) public train system (also known as the ‘L’ trains).</b> 
There are 8 train lines, 7 of which connect riders from various parts of the city and surrounding suburbs to the downtown area. The yellow line is a small line of only 3 stops connecting a far nothern suburb to another suburb in the north (seen like an extension to 3 other lines).

> This dataset lists monthly station entry averages, by day type (Weekday, Saturday or Sunday/Holiday), as well as monthly totals, beginning in 2001 up to June of 2018. Direct source (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-L-Station-Entries-Monthly-Day-Type-A/t2rn-p8d7).

> Since this dataset is focused on individual stops, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chicago_%22L%22_stations"
    title="With a Title">here is a link</a> showing the breakdown of which are the most popular lines, and which lines pass through each stop (since some stops have multiple lines). Below is an SVG image of the entire CTA 'L' line routes.
