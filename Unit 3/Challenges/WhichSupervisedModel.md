# For each, identify which supervised learning method(s) would be best for addressing that particular problem. Explain your reasoning and discuss your answers with your mentor.
<br>

1.	Predict the running times of prospective Olympic sprinters using data from the last 20 Olympics. <br>

>	Linear Regression – works with continuous data.<br>

2.	You have more features (columns) than rows in your dataset. <br>
>	SVM, PCA and Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Ridge and LASSO Regression<br>

3.	Identify the most important characteristic predicting likelihood of being jailed before age 20. <br>
>	Decision Tree, KNN<br>

4.	Implement a filter to “highlight” emails that might be important to the recipient.<br>
>	Logistic regression, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes

5.	You have 1000+ features.<br>
>	SVM, Ridge or LASSO regression, PCA and Linear Regression, Decision Trees

6.	Predict whether someone who adds items to their cart on a website will purchase the items.<br>
>	Logistic regression – binary classification. Purchase or no purchase. Decision Tree

7.	Your dataset dimensions are 982400 x 500<br>
>	Ridge or LASSO regression – built in dimensionality reduction uses penalties for feature importance, SVM, Random Forest, PCA and Linear Regression

8.	Identify faces in an image.<br>
>	SVM

9.	Predict which of three flavors of ice cream will be most popular with boys vs girls.<br>
