# For each of the following scenarios, call out the potential biases in the proposed experiment. Do your best to try to discover not only the bias, but the initial design. There is plenty of room for interpretation here, so make sure to state what assumptions you're making.
___

## You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
<p>Contextual bias – time of year with two different seasons that would affect swimsuit purchases. The initial experiment is probably following sales trends that are similar, but there may be a big sale going on in February which is usually considered on off season for swimming.</p>


## You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
<p>Sampling bias – these people are intentionally trying to cure their anxiety, or have some curiosity of their anxiety levels. The general population might be tested unknowingly and at random. The goal may have been to see if people who utilize a clinic have lower anxiety levels after treatment. Even though levels may decrease with treatment, those patients already had much higher levels of anxiety.</p>


## You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
<p>Bias in assignment to conditions – there’s no control group, and who’s to say website visitors actually live in the area or were just driving through the area. There’s truly nothing to compare it to and even if you had two groups, they’re probably going to react similarly. Any differences between the groups during the study must be due to the differences you introduce as part of the experiment. The goal was probably to what type of advertising would increase website visits, and they started with billboards.</p>


## You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
<p>Selection bias – the groups selected for the new loyalty program seem to be repeat customers. If there were no extra incentives for people to join the program, they’re just going to continue shopping as normal. </p>


## Contextual bias – because you haven’t provided buyers enough time to show a change. Most people don’t shop for things other than groceries on a weekly basis.
<p>In both cases of selection and contextual bias, if the loyalty program has perks and maybe something like receiving a large amount of loyalty points if their first purchase is within the first week, then there would be incentive for customers to be active within the specified time frame of the experiment, and then the tester could see if there were any change in website visits.</p>
