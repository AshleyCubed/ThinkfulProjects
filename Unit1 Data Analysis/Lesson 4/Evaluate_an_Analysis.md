#### Unit 1 Lesson 4 Project 4

##Read the following descriptions of an experiment and its analysis, identify the flaws in each, and describe what you would do to correct them.


### 1.	The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.


> 1.	There’s observer bias with Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader delivering the slogans to the droids, they’re both motivated to get the droids to agree to their slogan. There’s also contextual bias because some of the droids may have a better rapport with either Palpatine or Vader. To try and avoid these biases, it would be best if the message was written down maybe in an empty room so that each group could observe it and read the message on their own. Then the droids could be given a questionnaire as to how likely they would be willing to join the dark side given the slogan and whatever other factors were involved with trying to recruit them.


### 2.	In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.


> 2.	Because Windu is known to be good but stern and Jar Jar Binks is known to be more silly and clumsy, people could have easily reacted to their two spiels quite differently (contextual bias). Even though they both traveled to 8 planets (4 friendly and 4 unfriendly), the circumstances on each planet could be drastically different between each other, which could easily add more contextual bias. To correct any wrongs, two similar Jedi should go to the 8 planets, and when reporting back, some other survey data should be collect to get an idea of the demographics. There may be some underlying sampling bias that should be addressed.

### 3.	A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.


> 3.	Immediately you can see sampling bias since two of the five worksites are underrepresented with HR workers. Therefore, it will be difficult to compare the satisfaction of those two worksites compared to the others without having to skew the data. To address this, one would have to break down worker satisfaction for each worksite individually. Then you could compare job type among each worksite to get an idea of overall satisfaction, but still be able to easily see which site it performing well in a particular job type compared to other sites.


### 4.	When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.


> 4.	This is contextual bias because the company is saying the app is selling well by looking at app usage shortly after people have installed the app, instead of looking at the average lifetime use for each user and taking averages of those. There can still be bias found by looking at lifetime usage because if a significant number of users recently installed the app, then that’s a very short time span of use, which can look drastically different from users with long usage lifespans.


### 5.	To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.


> 5.	This is both bias in assignment to conditions as well as contextual bias. Nothing was said about seating arrangement, so students with same tests could have been sitting near each other, and still cheated. Cheating still could have happened if students realized that the tests were different but the questions were the same and used another method to indicate which question they needed the answer for. The method the students used to study could have resembled the questions in Version B in both the arrangement of questions and particular wording, making it seem easier for the student who studied. Lastly, students could have been coming in with their friends / study partners, therefore causing that group of students to more than likely receive the same version of the test since the test versions weren’t randomized. The best way to create randomness, would be to pass out a different version of the test to each student according to seating arrangement.
