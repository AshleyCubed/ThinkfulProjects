## Write up the essential points of a research proposal for an improved version of that experiment (U1L4P4).

> When taking pop quizzes, or turning in individual projects many students demonstrate a variety of levels of understanding. However, when taking tests, it seems that the poorer preforming students may be cheating as they pass with high grades. We want tests to show that all students are up to speed but not make the tests too easy, and we don’t want to encourage cheating. 

> Different versions of a test will decrease the chances of students cheating.

> Create three versions of a test, and distribute a different test to each student (order by version A, B, C, A, B, C, repeat). The variable of interest is average test scores between the randomized tests and the previous (one version) average test scores of the class. This is an A/B test where we’re comparing randomized test to one test being given to the class.

> We will administer the three version test for three test cycles and compare the average of each version of those tests to the original (non-versioned) test scores for each student. We will also look at the student’s individual grades to see if the new test is more challenging, and look to see if multiple students have the same scores with exact answers (both wrong and right) to gauge for cheating.

> If student test scores decrease by 1 standard deviation (using scores from earlier in the year) and multiple students don’t have the same exact score, conclude that randomized tests are more challenging and effective against cheating, so continue to administer multi versioned tests. If test scores for the next three test decreases among students, but by less than one standard deviation, observe for three more tests before deciding. If randomized test scores do not start to reflect students’ overall grades or multiple students have the same answers, stop administering the three version test as it is not preventing cheating.
